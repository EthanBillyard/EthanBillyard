      <h3>Film Experience:</h3>
      <p>My brother and I used to create short videos using a shoulder mounted Videocassette Recorder in 2004, when I was 4 years old. While the videos were nothing special technically, it was the moment that sparked my interest in creating films. In highschool I was finally able to develop my skills. I explored a wide range of video styles ranging from suspenseful action pieces, dramatic short films, comedy skits, and visual effects. I have competed provincially multiple times and was invited to participate in a national film competition for students, but was unable to attend. After graduating highschool I began pursuing a job where I could use my skills. That eventually brought me to Kipp Scott GMC Cadillac Buick, an automative dealership. I spent three years creating videos for their marketing department. By the end of my time there I had created over 800 videos for their team to use.</p>

        <h4>First Person Video:</h4>
        <p>This video was filmed almost entirely in first person with surround sound audio to immerse the viewer. Their were many new challenges for me to tackle when we were shooting this short film. The most notable would be creating the set pieces, it can be very difficult to hide the necessary lighting and crew members when the camera is attached to an actor's head and moves freely. My favourite aspect of this project was choreographing the final fight scene, while it is a little rough at times their were many new camera tricks that I had to learn since you are locked into one perspective and cannot make smooth jump-cuts.</p>

        <h4>GMC Sierra Demonstation:</h4>
        <p>I have produced many videos with a similar style to this. The easiest way to market a vehicle online is to have a visually striking video with a touch of personality. This video demonstrates my years of experience in creating cinematic videos with very little equipment. The entire video was created using a handheld Panasonic Lumix S1H mirrorless camera without a tripod or gimbal. I am especially proud of the extreme close-ups for the truck's details. It can be very hard to get a clean shot that close without some level of mechanical stabilization.</p>

        <h4>Bose Commercial Parody:</h4>
        <p>While this video is very flawed and does not show many technical skills, it is one of my favourites. I was with a couple of friends when a commercial for Bose headphones came on. The commercial was for the new noise cancelling feature and used the tag line "Block out the hate" as a group of teenage boys we immediately started talking about how we could relate this to a video about bullying. In our video the bully (played by me) begins with verbal abuse that the bullied student ignores, however it quickly elevates to physical violence, and that is when he tries to use his headphones to "block out the hate"</p>
