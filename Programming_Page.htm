      <h2>Programming Experience:</h2>
      <p>I began programming in 2022 when I enrolled in Red Deer Polytechnic's Computer Programming courses. During that time I have learned the Python, HTML, and CSS programming languages. Although my experience is quite limited, I have created a good amount of small projects that demonstrate the many skills I have begun to learn. Some of which are located below with links to view the source code or try the programs.</p>

        <img src="Images/ProgrammingFiles/Drawing_GUI.jpg" alt="A drawing done inside a python program">
        <p>The final project in my Python Programming course was to create a sketchbook that implements a Graphical User Interface. The final result turned out quite well considering that I have had no experience making a GUI before this project. However there are still many features that I would have implemented if I had the knowledge to do so at the time. <br><a href="Images/ProgrammingFiles/Drawing_GUI.py">Click here to download the sketchbook.</a></p>

      <div class="Programs Two">
        <img src="Images/ProgrammingFiles/Fibonacci_Calculator.jpg" alt="The code for a Fibonacci Calculator">
        <p>This project was created in Python for a general mathematics course about recursion. The program calls itself as many times as specified to calculate the Fibonacci value that the user wishes to know. Due to how taxing the calculation is on a computer I included a timer to show how long it takes to calculate the value. <br><a href="Images/ProgrammingFiles/Fibonacci_Calculator.py">Click here to download the Fibonacci Calculator.</a></p>

      <div class="Programs">
        <img src="Images/ProgrammingFiles/Sleep_Debt_Calculator.jpg" alt="The results of a sleep debt calculation">
        <p>This was one of the first programs that I wrote in Python. It asks the user to input information about their sleep patterns, then stores the data to calculate the user's sleep debt. Once it has done all the calculations it prints the results for the user and suggest how they can adjust their sleep patterns. <br><a href="Images/ProgrammingFiles/Sleep_Debt_Calculator.py">Click here to download the Sleep Debt Calculator.</a></p>
