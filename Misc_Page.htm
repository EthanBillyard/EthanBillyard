      <h2>Miscellaneous Projects:</h2>
      <p>This page contains other projects that I am proud of, but they don't fit into the categories of the main pages. All of the projects below were created in my free time. All the skills that I needed to create these projects were self-taught.</p>

    <div class="Blender">
      <img src="Images/MiscFiles/BlenderRender1.png" alt="A 3D Model of a futuristic piece of technology">
      <p>The image above was created after I had been struck with the inspiration to learn Blender, a 3D modelling program. After some consideration and seeing a video of a similar creation, I attempted to recreate it. After many hours of Google and struggling with a program I had never used I was able to create something that had resembled the final result. I continued to revisit the project and tweak small details until I was happy with the result. Some of these details include: Adding the glowing orange core, creating realistic lighting, and the subtle reflections off the surface below the object. Overall I am very happy with the result, and I was later able to use these new skills to create visual effects in some short films.</p>

    <div class="Redraw">
      <img src="Images/MiscFiles/Redraw.png" alt="A drawing from a panel in the manga Berserk">
      <p>This drawing is a personal favourite of mine. Berserk is a fantasy horror manga created by Kentaro Miura, he is acclaimed for the inticate and exciting drawings on every page of his works. I had wanted to learn a new style of drawing and figured a legend such as Miura would be worth immitating. I used a page from his manga as a reference and attempted to recreate the style that he employs to pull attention to the many details in the drawings. Due to the limitations I set on myself this single drawing had taken me many hours until I had felt that the style of the source material was properly replicated.</p>

    <div class="Drawing">
      <img src="Images/MiscFiles/Warhead.png" alt="A sketch of a 'Warhead'">
      <p>While this sketch is not as detailed as many of the drawings I have created, it is something I am very proud of. I was creating a short film that was set in a dystopian world where people were not seen as free individuals but rather as a resource. In this world the government would use human brains to control a lot of machinery. One of the concept design I created to show off this idea was the "Warhead" where a human brain was implanted into a missile and the brain would pilot the missile to the target. The project had to be abandoned due to time constraints, but I enjoyed the ideas that were made while writing.</p>
